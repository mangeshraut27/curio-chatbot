# 🐾 Curio – Stray Animal Rescue Chatbot (AI-Powered with OpenAI GPT)

Curio is a friendly, AI-powered chatbot that helps users report and handle stray animal issues with empathy and efficiency. Built using OpenAI's GPT models and deployed on Vercel, this project is structured in clear **phases** for rapid iteration and deployment.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) with Vercel Deployment
- **Backend**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 via API
- **AI Agent**: Prompt-based logic using OpenAI's Chat Completions
- **Testing**: Jest + Playwright (for UI/interaction)

## ✅ Phase Plan & What AI Builds in 2 Hours

### 🔹 Phase 1: MVP – Basic Chatbot

- [x] Chat UI built with React
- [x] OpenAI GPT integration (basic prompt)
- [x] Recognizes if a message is about a stray animal
- [x] Extracts: animal type, issue, and location
- [x] Suggests basic first aid tips using GPT
- [x] Generates structured rescue report
- [x] Tests written for all components

### 🔹 Phase 2: Smart Triage & Location

- [ ] Assign urgency levels (low/med/high) using GPT
- [ ] Ask for more precise location if missing
- [ ] Validate prompt consistency

### 🔹 Phase 3: NGO Recommendations

- [ ] Use a static JSON file of NGOs per city/area
- [ ] Match location to NGO
- [ ] Add fallback message if none found

### 🔹 Phase 4: Community + Media

- [ ] Allow image uploads (future GPT-4 Vision)
- [ ] Show list of recently reported cases (local JSON)
- [ ] Share button for posting to X/WhatsApp

| `test-animal-extraction` | Validates correct extraction of animal type from sample prompts |
| `test-issue-extraction` | Ensures correct parsing of problem (e.g., injured, unconscious) |
| `test-location-followup` | Confirms bot asks for location when it's not provided |
| `test-care-response` | Tests whether bot returns a first-aid message |
| `test-report-format` | Ensures the final report is JSON structured and complete |

### 🔜 Phase 2+ Tests (Planned)
